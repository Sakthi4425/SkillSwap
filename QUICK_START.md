# Quick Start Guide - SkillSwap React App

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Invalid Credentials Error
**Problem**: Existing users couldn't log in because they didn't have authentication tokens.

**Solution**: Created tokens for all existing users. The script has been run and tokens are now created for:
- sakthi
- Arunkumar
- Arun (already had token)
- Suresh
- Vijay
- Anitha
- Mani
- Kavitha
- Rajesh
- Meena (already had token)

**How to fix for future users**: When you add new users, run:
```bash
python create_tokens_for_users.py
```

### 2. Home Page
**Problem**: Missing home page in the React app.

**Solution**: Added a beautiful landing page at the root URL (`/`) that shows:
- App introduction
- Key features (Learn, Teach, Connect)
- Sign up and Login buttons

## 🚀 How to Run

### Start Backend (Django)
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Start Frontend (React)
Open a **new terminal window**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm start
```

### Or use the batch file:
```bash
start_server.bat
```

## 📍 Application URLs

- **Home Page**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Login**: http://localhost:3000/login
- **Signup**: http://localhost:3000/signup
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard (login required)
- **Profile**: http://localhost:3000/profile (login required)
- **Matches**: http://localhost:3000/matches (login required)

## 🔑 Login Credentials

You can now log in with any of the existing users:
- username: sakthi (and password you set)
- username: Arunkumar (and password you set)
- username: Arun (and password you set)
- etc.

**Note**: If you've forgotten passwords, you'll need to reset them or create a new account.

## 🎨 Features

### Teaching Sessions
- When you're teaching someone, the session shows as "Ongoing" for you
- Once you mark it as "Completed", it shows a green "Completed" badge
- You can see all your teaching sessions on the Dashboard

## 💡 Using the App

1. **Home Page**: Visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the landing page
2. **Sign Up**: Create a new account if needed
3. **Login**: Use your existing credentials

5. **Find Matches**: Click "Find Matches" to see potential teachers
6. **Request Session**: Click "Request Session" and select a time
7. **Dashboard**: View all your sessions (as teacher or learner)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Login?
1. Make sure you're using the correct username and password
2. Tokens have been created for all users
3. Try creating a new account if needed

### Empty Dashboard?
- You need to request sessions first (go to "Find Matches")
- Add skills to your profile to find matches

### No Matches Showing?
- Update your profile and add "Skills to Learn"
- The app only shows teachers who teach skills you want to learn

### Session Status Not Updating?
- Make sure the Django backend is running
- Check the browser console for errors
- Refresh the page

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend is running on port 8000
2. ✅ Frontend is running on port 3000  
3. ✅ All users have tokens
4. ✅ Home page is available
5. 🎉 You're ready to use the app!
